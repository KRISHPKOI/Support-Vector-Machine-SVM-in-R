```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r}
rm(list = ls())
head(iris)
```

```{r}
library(e1071)

# Model Building

```{r}
model <- svm(Species ~ ., data = iris)
summary(model)
```

Y- gamma in Svm model
- This is the idea how far the decision boundary from the points. Lower the value of Y, more linear the decision boundry.
which is good.


# Tuning svm parameters Y and C

```{r}
#tune.result <- tune(svm, train.x = iris[1:4]
```
